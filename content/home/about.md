# Biography

Welcome to my personal page!


I am an Electrical and Computer Systems Engineer and my primary focus is
data science and machine learning. I hold a research associate position at the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications of the National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”, where I am involved in international projects. I work along the Software and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory and I conduct research under the guidance of Dr. Georgios Paliouras. I am mostly intrested in classical machine learning, basic research and applications on text and the biomedical domain.
