In the context of the IASIS project we utilized speech transcripts of patients with Alzheimer's Disease in order to create a system to accurately assess the risk of the patients. We focused on syntactical, morphological, lexical and other language features (errors, omitions, stuttering etc.) that was observed in the patients' speech, in order to derive a classifcation system for early-risk assessment through a non-obtrusive task. 

The work helped with the creation of the spin-off LangAware by Vassiliki Rentoumi.

LangAware is a health & deep tech company which uses Artificial Intelligence to predict neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s by detecting and monitoring digital biomarkers based on language and speech. The LangAware platform solution is aimed at various clinical settings, including primary healthcare, as a quick screening tool to identify people with high risk to develop Alzheimer’s or other neurodegenerative diseases. The platform’s high sensitivity and specificity can lead to larger numbers of patients being identified earlier, thus stratified and treated more effectively.
